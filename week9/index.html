                    To preserve a livable climate, greenhouse-gas emissions must be reduced by half by 2030 and to net
                    zero by 2050. Bold, fast, and wide-ranging action needs to be taken by governments and businesses.
                    But the transition to a low-carbon world also requires the participation of citizens – especially in
                    advanced economies.

                <p>
                    ActNow is the United Nations campaign for individual action on climate change and sustainability.
